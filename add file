DevOps is a set of practices, culture, and tools that bring software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams together.
Its main goal is to deliver software faster, more reliably, and efficiently.

Before DevOps, developers wrote code and passed it to operations teams to deploy and maintain. This caused delays, errors, and communication gaps.
DevOps removes these barriers by promoting continuous collaboration and automation.

✅ Why DevOps?

Traditional software delivery was slow because:

Manual processes caused delays.

Miscommunication between Dev and Ops teams.

Errors often appeared late in development.

DevOps solves these problems by:

Increasing automation

Improving communication

Ensuring faster releases

✅ Key Principles of DevOps

Collaboration & Communication
Developers + Operations work together throughout the software lifecycle.

Automation
Automated testing, integration, deployment, and monitoring.

Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
Code is integrated and deployed frequently to reduce risks.

Monitoring & Feedback
Systems are continuously monitored to improve quality.

Incremental Improvements
Small but frequent updates instead of big releases.

✅ DevOps Lifecycle

Plan → Requirements & objectives

Develop → Coding

Build → Compile code

Test → Automated testing

Release → Versioning & packaging

Deploy → Push to production

Operate → Manage & support

Monitor → Track performance & issues

This cycle repeats continuously to improve the product.
